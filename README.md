Hi, I'm Melody! 👋

👩‍💻 I am a full-stack software developer with almost 17 years of experience in
building enterprise-level applications and integrations. I have a proven record
for delivering innovative and creative solutions on time and under budget. I've
written software for a wide variety of industries but my biggest areas have been
in higher education (user portals, SIS and LMS integrations) and ERP/LOB
applications (focused in the fire & life safety industry).

🌈 I am an open and proud transgender woman. I strive everyday to be the most
authentic version of myself, and I try to inspire and empower others to do the
same. I do the best I can to treat everyone with compassion and empathy, and I
try leave the world a better place than how I found it.
